Just like donating blood, people around the world can contribute to decentralised medical science by sharing their medical history with researchers via informed consent. Data Heroes (those who have contributed their medical data) do so via the blockchain, and by doing so become eligible for rewards and discounts on healthcare and wellness products and services.",
